    This program:
        a. Starts with best X reccomendations, based on top ROI list and stock that are in play.
        b. then searches new stocks based on consistancy?? (run an Adj. R^2 on just the stock for all time, sort by highest)


Preprocessing:
1. Composes data to be used to make an analysis. 
2. Uses adjusted R^2 value to rank incoming data. 
3. Creates a Delta adjusted R^2 table to rank data. 
4. Searches adding additional data combinations ?randomly? to find better fits.

Predictive Analysis:
1. Finds the best model for a given stock
2. Creates that model
3. Saves it in the folder with the stock.

Create Recomendations:
1. Uses created models to calculate ROI
